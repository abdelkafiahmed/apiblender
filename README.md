# Load an interaction 
blender.list_interactions()
interaction_name = 'photos_search'
blender.load_interaction(interaction_name)

# Set the parameters
# Serveral parameters can be passed at the same time
blender.list_url_params()
key =   'tags'
value = 'good spirit'
blender.set_url_params({key: value})

# Execute the request and get the results
result = blender.blend()
result['blender_config']
result['timestamp']
result['raw_content']               # Result content as a string
